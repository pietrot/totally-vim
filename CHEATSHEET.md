## SEARCH/REPLACE
#### Across folders & subfolders
If you want to perform a search/replace across you project tree, you can use vim's argument list.
```
:args **/*.{file_ext}
:argdo %s/{search}/{replace}/g
```
You can even use the shell's find command to get a list of all files in the current directory by running:
```
:args `find . -type f`
```
You can view the current args list by running `:args` by itself. If you want to add or delete files from the list, you can use the `:argadd` or the `:argdelete` commands respectively.
