## FOLDING
### Configuration
```
" Folding options
set foldenable
set foldmethod=syntax
set foldlevel=999
set foldcolumn=0
```
### Hotkeys
- `zo` opens a fold at the cursor
- `zO` opens all folds at the cursor
- `zc` close one fold under the cursor
- `zC` close all folds under the cursor recursively
- `za` toggle fold
- `zR` opens all folds in current buffer
- `zM` closes all folds in current buffer

## COPY/PASTE/DELETE
- `gv` recover previous selection
- `dd` delete current line from cursor position
- `dw` delete current word from cursor position
- `x` delete current character from cursor position

## SEARCH/REPLACE
### Across folders & subfolders
If you want to perform a search/replace across you project tree, you can use vim's argument list.
```
:args **/*.{file_ext}
:silent! argdo %s/{search}/{replace}/g | update #:update is used because it will only save the file if it has changed.
```
#### Notes:
- `:update` is used to save the file after it has changed
- `silent` skips displaying normal messages
- `!` skips displaying error messages
- you can use the shell's find command to get a list of all files in the current directory by running:
  ```
  :args `find . -type f`
  ```
- you can view the current args list by running `:args` by itself. If you want to add or delete files from the list, you can use the `:argadd` or the `:argdelete` commands respectively.
